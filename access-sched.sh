# access-sched.sh — «РАСПИСАНИЯ ДОСТУПА»: when a device may go out to the internet. ONE owner of the registry, the evaluator, the
# kernel form and the per-minute tick. Design: dev notes «расписания-дизайн».
#
# Model. A schedule = devices (keyed by MAC — an address is only lent for a lease, a MAC-keyed rule does not drift to a
# neighbour) + a week of windows of three states (open · limited · closed) + the state OUTSIDE the windows (`base`). Overlap ⇒
# the stricter state wins; a window whose end is not after its start runs past midnight and belongs to the day it STARTS on
# (Fri 23:00–07:00 covers Saturday 00:00–07:00); start = end is a whole day. Actions over the schedule carry their own expiry
# (close now / open for… / postpone — `<id>.ovr`; «close all now» — `.all`; holidays — `hol`). One device = one schedule.
#
# LEVEL-TRIGGERED, not edge-triggered: there is no «close at 23:00» event pair in cron. Every minute the tick computes «what
# must be true now» and converges the kernel to it — so a reboot at 23:30, a clock step, a firewall reload that wiped our chain,
# a missed minute all heal by themselves on the next tick. The tick has its own cron line (install.sh `cron_put`): the
# watchdog's tick can run tens of minutes (failover ladder) and a 23:00 close would wait for it; heal runs once per boot.
#
# FAIL-OPEN ON AN UNSYNCED CLOCK. The router has no RTC: after a boot the clock sits on a file's mtime (a sane-looking date
# hours or days behind) until it is synced. Windows applied by that clock would close the internet in the middle of the day —
# worse than not closing. So nothing is installed until clock-lib.sh says the time is synced (`clock_trusted`), and the panel
# says so in words.
# …AND ONLY WHILE OUR TICK IS IN THE CRONTAB (`sc_ticking`). A level-triggered rule needs someone to lift it at the window's end:
# deactivation takes the cron line (uninstall.sh step_cron), and a rule a panel action or a tick in flight put back then would
# stand for good (review s.112). Without the line every schedule reads «stop» — nothing in the kernel, the panel says why.
#
# Kernel form — filter FORWARD, both families (the only place every forwarded packet passes, tunnelled or not):
#   FORWARD 1: -j ENODIA_SCHED
#   ENODIA_SCHED: -o br+ -j RETURN — the home network stays (measured BE7000: bridge-nf-call-iptables=1, so bridged LAN frames
#                 traverse FORWARD too, and a bare per-MAC DROP would cut the printer and the cameras);
#                 closed — `-m mac --mac-source M` → REJECT (tcp-reset for TCP): the app fails at once instead of hanging on
#                 a TCP timeout. INPUT stays open (DNS, the panel) — and the REDIRECTed DNS of a limited device is ACCEPTed
#                 at its top (`ENODIA_SCHED_DNSIN`, `--ctstate DNAT` to its profile's port): stock `miot_input` DROPs all
#                 but DHCP from br-miot before any zone, and a zone without redirects has no «accept port redirections»
#                 (BE7000 09.10.2026) — the device would be left with no DNS at all;
#                 limited — only DoT/DoQ (853) REJECTed: names go through our filter, see below; addresses the schedule
#                 closes — REJECT to its set (`enodia_sch_<id>`, v6 `enodia_sch6_<id>`).
# «ОГРАНИЧЕНО» = OUR DNS FILTER, not address sets (decided 08.10.2026: categories share anycast frontends — closing youtube.com by
# address closes Google Search and Gemini on the device too; «only allowed» cannot be said by address; and dnsmasq has no
# per-client answers). The DNS of a limited device is REDIRECTed by MAC (nat PREROUTING `ENODIA_SCHED_DNS`, at the top — above
# the stock guest DNAT; both families) to the port of its schedule's PROFILE in `dns-filter` (component «filter», source
# dev/dns-filter/): it answers «nothing there» for the chosen categories and own sites and passes the rest to dnsmasq. Category
# data is geo.sh's (the one owner): `geo.sh want sched <keys>` on a save, READY forms by `geo.sh ready` in the tick — never a
# fetch here. No filter binary, or it does not answer its probe after a restart ⇒ limited devices stay OPEN (fail-open, as with
# the clock) and the journal says why once. Without ip6 nat the device's IPv6 is REJECTed whole and its DNS to the router's v6
# addresses refused in INPUT (`ENODIA_SCHED_IN6`) — it falls back to IPv4, where the REDIRECT stands.
# ADDRESSES TOO, where names cannot do it (phone walk BE7000 08.10.2026: everything chosen closed except Telegram). Telegram dials
# the addresses built into the app, past DNS, so a filter of names leaves it working; its network carries nothing but Telegram —
# the anycast reason above does not hold for it. So a curated category may carry ADDRESS keys (SC_CATS, third field), a pool of
# the geo catalogue may be an address one (`geo=`, runetfreedom geoip, a country), and own sites may be addresses (`addr=`).
# geo.sh hands their data in (the same `ready`, bogons cut there); a set per SCHEDULE and family (set-lib.sh fills it, an
# unchanged one is not touched), alive only while some limited device of the schedule needs it.
# Two modes. «block» — the chosen names are answered «nothing there», the chosen addresses REJECTed. «allow» — every name but
# the chosen ones (and connectivity checks) is answered «nothing there»; addresses cannot say «only these» (an allowed site lives
# on any CDN address), so there they work one way only: the address keys of the curated categories NOT allowed are REJECTed —
# otherwise Telegram, not allowed, would still connect by its built-in addresses.
# SAFE SEARCH (`safe=1`): the same filter answers the search engines' names with their own safe front doors (dev/dns-filter,
# SAFE_MAP; YouTube moderate). It acts ALL DAY except closed time — a device of such a schedule whose week says «open» is in the
# plan as «safe»: its DNS is REDIRECTed to a profile without lists (`port P block - safe`), DoT refused as in «limited»; nothing
# else is closed. A dead filter takes it away with «limited» (fail-open, said once in the journal).
# After a device's state changes, its established flows are dropped (`ct_flush_src` per address of the MAC): NSS/ECM keeps
# offloaded flows out of netfilter otherwise. Never a global flush — a 23:00 close would drop every call in the house.
# A plan that closes nobody = no chain at all (no footprint while everything is open).
#
# Usage:
#   access-sched.sh list-json | get-json <id> | dump
#   access-sched.sh save <specfile> | del <id> | toggle <id> on|off
#   access-sched.sh ovr <id> close|open|postpone|clear [minutes|HH:MM|end|0]
#   access-sched.sh all <minutes|HH:MM|0|off> | hol <id> <YYYY-MM-DD|off>
#   access-sched.sh tick | unwire
# JSON verbs print one JSON object; messages are Russian (the panel translates them by its dictionary).
